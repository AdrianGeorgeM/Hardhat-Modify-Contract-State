# Sample Hardhat Project

Set up a simple Hardhat project structure, add a contract with a state variable
and a function to modify it. And then write a quick test to make sure the
function modifies the state variable as expected.

# In your project root folder, run npx hardhat test

Extra Challenges: Create a new type string state variable and modify it Change
the constructor argument Add a new test Create a scripts directory, deploy your
contract and change the contract state
